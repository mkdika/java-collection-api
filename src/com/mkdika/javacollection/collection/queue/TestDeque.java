/*

    Usually pronounced as deck, a deque is a double-ended-queue. A double-ended-queue 
    is a linear collection of elements that supports the insertion and removal 
    of elements at both end points. The Deque interface is a richer abstract 
    data type than both Stack and Queue because it implements both stacks and 
    queues at the same time. The Deque interface, defines methods to access 
    the elements at both ends of the Deque instance. Methods are provided 
    to insert, remove, and examine the elements. Predefined classes like 
    ArrayDeque and LinkedList implement the Deque interface.
